One form of database is called Redis.
This database stores data in the RAM. This means that the data is not persistent.

Because it is in the primary memory, retrieval of it is faster than in disks.

A term for such a database is called in-memory.

In-memory databases like Redis usually cache data that is required frequently.

The idea is this: there is a traditional database behind the scenes, and Redis.

Data that is frequently being requested: pull from traditional database and put into Redis.

The exercise attempts to enumerate a Redis server remotely then dumping the database to retrieve a flag.

The redis-cli command line utility is being used.

We use ping > nmap to scan for services : nmap -p- sV
-p- suggests that all ports should be scanned.

-sV means scan type is should scan for version of the services running on the ports.

Running the scan on the virtual machine, we see that Redis is open on port 6379. Version is 5.0.7

Using redis-tools cli, we connect to the service. Typing info in the cli provides us
information in the shell, regarding information of the database.

Under the keyspace section lists the databases. We see only 1. To access, one can call "select 0"
To list all keys in the database: keys *
Then we call "get "flag"" to get the flag: 03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb
