prefix man for manual. --h or -help is a short form for it.

Each manual has a short description available within it.
The command "apropos <keyword>" returns a succinct summary of the command.

System information
The following are useful system commands:
whoami => displays current username
uname => displays basic information about OS and system
ifconfig => assign or view addresses to a network interface and or configure its parameters
ip => utility to show routing, network devices, interfaces and tunnels. Also used for changing its settings.
netstat => shows network settings
ps => shows process status
who => displays who is logged in
env => displays environment (variables)
lsblk => displays blocked devices
lsusb => displays USB devices
lsof => displays open files
lspci => displays PCI devices
hostname => prints the name of the computer we are logged in to.
Differs from whoami which shows the username; not the name of the computer.

id
This command builds on top of the whoami command and prints out the effective group membership and IDs. Useful to probe for more information regarding groups and identities in them.
There are some existing built-in groups:
adm: admin group: can read logs in var/logs
sudo: all-powerful root user: can run anything. Can be used for escalating privileges
for other users.

uname can be used to detect system information regarding the machine; then from there one can scan for vulnerabilities on the machine.


Logging in via SSH:
SSH is a protocol that allows clients to access and execute commands on a remote computer.
Typically used for Linux-based hosts and or Unix-like OS.
SSH login: ssh [username]@[IP address]

mail spool:
a location where the computer temporarily stores incoming and outgoing email messages before processed by the mail application
In Linux, this location is typically: /var/spool/main/$USER

/var directory contains files that are expected to change in size or content as the system operates.

The env command in Linux can provide a lot of information - environment variables and values set on the computer.

MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit. Largest size of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network connection. Size of payload portion.
The downsides of having larger packets: Higher chance of packet fragmentation which will have more overhead.

Navigation
ls vs dir: dir is used in Windows command prompt; ls is used in Unix-like systems
ls -l provides more information : long format
ls -a lists all files of a directory. + hidden files
ls -i lists in the inode numbers of each file or directory

inode is a data structure used by UNIX-like systems to store metadata regarding a file or directory in a system.
It contains information about a file; and also within it a pointer to its actual address (data blocks) on the physical disk where the file contents are stored.

After cd, you can call cd - to return back to previous directory

Shortcut: you can call like cd D
Then the D represents some directory. From here, you can press tab to auto-complete if there is only one directory that starts with D; else twice to display all directories starting with that letter.

rmdir to remove directories; rm to remove files

One dot (.) represents current directory; two dots (..) represents parent directory
clear clears the terminal



File and directory manipulation
mkdir makes a directory; touch creates a file
mkdir -p /directory/path
-p with mkdir allows you to create a directory at a given path.

tree .
This will print out a nicely-formatted tree-like structure of your directory.
Root is your current directory.

mv <from> <to>
This command is not just for moving files; it can be used for renaming as well.

cp <from> <to>
This command copy-pastes the directory from and to the designated path.


ls -lt will also sort based on time (-t parameter)





Editing files
We use a text editor.
Nano editor is used in this example:
nano notes.txt creates a new file called notes.txt

In the editor:
The caret (^) stands for our "[CTRL]" key.

The exit functionality will save the file

To view contents of a file: cat <file>

Vim
Open-source text editor.
Has 5 modes:
1. Normal
    a. All inputs are treated as editor commands. We start here
2. Insert
    b. All inputs are inserted.
3. Visual
    c. Mark parts of text. These marked texts then can be manipulated - replaced; deleted; copied...
4. Command
    d. All inputs are treated as single-line commands at bottom of editor. Commands are like sorting; replacing sections; deleting them...
5. Replace
    e. All inputs will replace existing once. If no existing character at position to replace, then it creates the new input.

vimtutor is an excellent way to start using Vim.



Finding files and directories:
which <executable program>: this returns the file path of executable program.
find <directory>: lists all files in that directory. Can chain with grep to quickly locate a file.

find has configurations which can make the search faster: examples:
-type f searches for objects that are "files"
-user root: filters for option whose owner is root.
-size +20k: filter for files with sizes > 20k

The idea of caching your searches: locate command.
locate
This will work with a local database that stores all information about existing files and folders.
We can update this local database with "sudo updatedb".
After updating, you can notice a significant speed increase in the locating of a file
locate *.txt


find -newermnt: newer than modification time.
So you input -newermnt YYYY-MM-DD to find files newer than that date.

find -type f -name "*.conf"
This uses a wildcard - finds files that ends with .conf

2>/dev/null
Calling it will redirect all error messages to a special device file that discards all
data written to it.
Use this to silence error messages or unwanted outputs


wc -l
Very useful tool. wc stands for word count. Can be used to count number of files
(number of lines) in the output.
-l stands for line.
