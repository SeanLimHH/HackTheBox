To attack the target machine, you must be on the same network.

Hack The Box uses OpenVPN. First task is to connect to it

When first starting a penetration test or any security evaluation on a target, a primary step is known as Enumeration.

This step consists of documenting the current state of the target to learn as much as
possible about it.

When you are connected to the VPN as the target host:
If the target machine is a web server, running a web page, you can navigate to its IP address to see what the page contains. 
If the target is a storage server, you can connect to it using the same IP address to
explore the files and folders stored on it, provided that you have the necessary credentials. 

However, we will take a lot of time if we manually search for them.

Every server uses ports in order to serve data to clients.
The first step of Enumeration is to scan for open ports. Here they use nmap.

Open ports => can manually check if you have access. Different services => require different technologies to access.

Here, it is important to note that it is not practical to know everything. So we just have to know what is necessary, and to know what is necessary.

The command ping: sends a packet. Checks for response.
It uses an ICMP echo request.
For now, i understand it as a troubleshooting tool.

nmap -sV: -s is type of scan, -V is verbose output.

Running nmap on the given target machine, we can see that port 23 is open; telnet.

Telnet gives a sort of terminal for clients to interact with the server.
Usually, it has username and password requirements for enhanced security.

In the exercise, it is informed that one can use a brute-force approach, iterating through possibilities in an attempt to log in.

Here, we telnet the IP address, login using the information in the task list and there is the flag.txt. cat flag.txt gives us the flag:
