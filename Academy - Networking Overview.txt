ISPs:

DNS -> Internet -> ISP

Then ISPs connect to either home or companies:
Home:

ISP -> Router -> Devices

Companies:

ISP -> Router -> Switch (Here we enter the company's network):
1. Switch -> DMZ -> Web server
2. Switch -> IP Phone
3. Switch -> Printer
4. Switch -> Client Host
The switch and router in this case should be on an administrative network
The printer should be on a separate network, and the client hosts on a separate network
The printer should also never talk to the Internet

Website: Uniform Resource Locater (URL)
This is considered as a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)

Consider: We visit a website
A website can be thought of as an address
The router is an way for us to connect to the Internet
Our packets that we send to the router will go through the ISP.

The ISP will observe the DNS to resolve the corresponding IP address.

Wide Area Network (WAN): known as the Internet

Local Area Network (LAN) / Wide Local Area Network (WLAN)
No difference between them.
Typically, they will assign IP addresses to your device.
This is done via a process called Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)

Virtual Private Network (VPN)
There are 3 kinds:
1. Site-to-site VPN
    Used to join networks in different places together; to be treated as Local
2. Remote Access VPN
    This makes the person intending to join the VPN have his client create a software-based
    representation that mimics a network interface card (NIC) found in computers.
    This is a virtual network interface.
    After creation of this interface, the person can just access the remote network as
    though his computer is part of the network.

    An example is HackTheBox, which uses OpenVPN. This OpenVPN client creates a TUN adapter
    (TUN stands for tunnel) which enables us to join the labs.

Typically, when devices connect to a VPN, the device creates a routing table that will
determine how traffic flows. This table shows which IP addresses are accessible within the
network and which ones are not. Those that are not are accessed through the internet.

In a Split-Tunnel VPN, this routing table only creates routes for required specific networks
that can only be access via the VPN. So, other routes, other addresses, will all proceed to the
internet from the client-side. Hence it is called split-tunnel, because there are two tunnels
that are inaccessible from each other. HackTheBox uses this which promotes privacy.

In the case of company networks, Split-Tunnel VPNs are not recommended since if the client
is infected with malware, it will be harded to debug

3. SSL VPN

This is a VPN that is more associated with corporate networks than home networks.
This uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide secure remote access to private networks.
The process of SSL VPNs:
    1. Your device connects to the SSL VPN server using a web browser or a dedicated
    SSL VPN client software.
    2. Then, your browser provides required authentication credentials to the SSL VPN server to be 
    authenticated.
    3. Once authenticated, the SSL VPN server will establish a secure SSL/TLS connection
    with your client. This connection encrypts all data flows between the client and the server

SSL VPN servers are literally dedicated computers that sit in a company's server rack, that handles
the exchange of cryptographic keys with clients that want to interact with the company's internal network.




Global Area Network (GAN)

The Internet is an example of this. Huge companies maintain their own isolated networks that can
span across countries (has many WANs), and are considered GANs. Typically undersea cables or satellite
transmission


Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

Connects multiple LANs.
Typically, these are individual branches of a company connected to a MAN via leased lines.


Personal Area Network (PAN) or Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) 
Example is mobile hotspots


Network Topology
This is a term to refer to the arrangement of logical connections of devices in a network.
Includes clients, servers, network components like routers, switches, bridges.

Has 3 main areas:

1. Connections
    Wired and Wireless.
    Wired will include the cable types like coaxial cable, twisted pair cables ...
    Wireless will include the different types too: Wi-Fi, Cellular, Satellite...

2. Nodes (Network Interface Controllers)
    These are like connection points:
    Repeaters, hubs, firewalls, switches, routers, gateways, bridges...

3. Classification
    Has a few types:
    Point-to-point, bus, ring, star, mesh, daisy-chain...


Point-to-point Topology
A straightforward physical link connects two devices.
Not to confuse with peer-to-peer architecture.

Bus Topology
No central network component; every host can control the signals sent.
One host sends; others evaluate

Star Topology
All hosts connect to one central network component. Typically a hub, router or switch.
This central network component will redirect data to intended devices.

Ring Topology
For each host in a ring arrangement: one cable enters and one cable leaves.
Coordination is done via a protocol all hosts agree on.

Mesh Topology
This is situational. There are two general structures: fully-meshed and partially-meshed.
For a fully-meshed structure: this is like a complete graph.
Used in WAN to ensure high reliability and stability.
This setup: important network nodes like routers can be networked together. If one fails,
others can work without problems.

In a partially-meshed structure, each endpoint is connected by only one connection.

Tree Topology
Often used in large companies.
The server is the root, then its childrens are ethernet switches, then host computers.

Daisy Chain Topology
Often used in automation technology.
A computer connects to a computer connects to another computer like a tree with one child only.
