Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environments.

It provides authentication and authorisation features but is argued to have vulnerabilities.
Hence this module.

Fundamentally, AD is a read-only database.
Anyone can read the AD, regardless of permissions.

It is important to configure AD correctly as it can reveal a lot of sensitive information if not
carefully configured.
It is noted that managing an AD properly is a difficult task since fixing one issue can lead to
another one.

Here, the module will cover the foundations of AD.

Structure: Distributed and hierarchical.
Purpose is to centrally manage organisation resources - users, groups, devices, file shares, group
policies, servers, workstations.

Primarily associated with Windows environment.


Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS)
This is a domain service that provides ways to store directory data.
It stores information like username and passwords. It manages the rights of who can access this data.


At the top of AD, is a forest containing one or more domains. Each domain can have their own subdomains.

We call a forest a boundary. Within it are security controls. Each forest can contain multiple domains.


Domain
This is a structure where its contained objects are accessible. The contained objects are users, computers
and groups.


Organisational Unit (OU)
Each domain can have one or more of these. An OU allows for management of objects.
These objects are like users, computers, groups...
Management here more specifically refers to setting policies for these set of groups.

Just visualise for simplicity: multiple forests. Within each forests you have domains. Within each domains
you have OUs.


Concept of trust
You could have two separate domains each in two separate forests have a trust with each other. A proverbial
connection.
This trusts enables only communication between them.

The core concept is that children of one forest, may not necessarily be able to access the children of the
other forest. However, the "root" of the first forest, since it has a trust with the "root" of the other forest,
can access the children of the other second forest.

It is also common to see trust set up between multiple domains and or multiple forests
