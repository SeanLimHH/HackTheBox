Metasploit is Ruby-based.
Idea is that you can write, test and execute code (exploits)
Also, you can take exploits (code) from existing databases written for existing
vulnerabilities via Metasploit.

Metasploit has two parts of its product - Pro and Framework.
Differences are features. Pro version has its own console as well.

We typically interface with the Metasploit framework via the console: msfconsole.
It is the only way you can access most of the features within Metasploit. So it is
good to be familiar with it.

All the base files relating to the framework are in /usr/share/metasploit-framework

So we can find modules in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules,
plugins in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins,
scripts in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts,
tools in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We start the interaction with the framework via "msfconsole"

The concept to begin running an exploit also follows outside using the framework: enumeration first.
In fact, the workflow of using the framework mirrors that of the approach without using
the framework

This engagement structure in Metasploit's framework is composed of five parts:
1. Enumeration
2. Preparation
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Post-Exploitation

Knowing the above by heart enables us to quickly dive into which features of MSF that
we wish to use. So it is wise to be very clear on which section we are doing at any given
moment.
