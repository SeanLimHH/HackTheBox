Key ideas that will be explored in this module:

1. Attacks on the Link Layer
2. Attacks on the IP Layer
3. Attacks on the Transport Layer
4. Attacks on the Network Layer

Goal is detection in this module.

Some topics covered here will be logs analysis, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).



ARP
We will study ARP first as the notes point out that many attackers typically
launch many attacks from ARP.

It is the first protocol that should be scrutinised also because the attacks here
are harder to detect due to untargeted nature of it. So it does not aim a target,
but more of a broadcast. Hence it is harder to identify.

Steps: Host A needs to send data to Host B
(From Host A's perspective)
1. Figure out Host B's physical address (MAC)
2. Lookup the ARP cache. This consists a list of known addresses.
Reason for lookup is to see if B's MAC address exists there. If so, no need to do
the following steps. It will simply jump to step 5.
3. (Not in ARP cache): Host A broadcasts an ARP request to all machines in the subnet.
3a. B will pick out this request; as its physical address is in the ARP request itself.
3b. B will then respond to this request; it sends back to host A with an ARP reply.
3c. The ARP reply will contain the mapping; of host B's IP address and MAC address.
4. The ARP reply is sent from host B to host A.
5. Host A updates his own ARP cache with the details of the mapping received.


ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning
From the above's process, we can clearly see that it is possible for an attacker to act
as a host B and reply to host A.

Solutions
1. Use predefined mappings
    Manually configure the ARP mappings. So you can have no need to consult the ARP table.
    This means preventing automatic changes. Make changes only possible via manual changes

2. Restrict access to switches and routers via port security
    Restrict the access of ports in the switches and routers. Only ensure that admins can
    access it.



tcpdump
This is a tool to capture all packets and traffic.

Basic usage: Capturing all packets live. eth0 is NIC
'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w outputFileOfCapture.pcapng'

To specifically capture only ARP:
'sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w outputFileOfCapture.pcapng arp'



Opening .pcapng files
Use Wireshark

In this notes, i am provided a sample ARP spoofing .pcapng file

If you observe many requests or replies being sent from a device
within a short time frame, the device is suspicious.

opcode functionality in Wireshark enables filtering:
1. arp.opcode == 1 represents all types of ARP requests
2. arp.opcode == 2 represents all types of ARP replies

As we proceed to click on an entry:
We see for a subsequent reply-request in the example, a yellow information box:
Duplicate IP address detected for 192.168.10.4 (50:eb:f6:ec:0e:7f) - also in use by 08:00:27:53:0c:ba (frame 25)
This message suggests that an IP address is mapped to two different MAC addresses.
Wireshark figures this out by comparing the source and destination host IP and MAC
addresses.

To filter out duplicate records: use filter
arp.duplicate-address-detected && arp.opcode == 2

Solution to this: how to figure out?
Determine the discrepancy devices' initial (first) IP address.
Because devices can change their MAC address.

Using a wireshark filter: (arp.opcode) && ((eth.src == <MAC address>) || (eth.dst == <MAC address>)).
Then, observe the first entry of the broadcast.
Under ARP (request), we can see the fields Sender MAC address and Sender IP address.
We have to use these two fields, interpret them. This is done by realising that these two are mapped initially.

Next, we have two other fields in it: target IP address and target MAC address.
So mentally we have this MAC address mapped to this IP address.
Then, the target MAC address is localhost (00:00:00_00:00:00)
and the new target IP is something else.
This is a clear sign that the attacker changed his own IP address to a new one.


Another indicator: consistently dropping TCP connections
This suggests that the attacker is not forwarding traffic to the router.
In Wireshark, this is shown as: [TCP Retransmission]



ARP scanning and Denial-of-Service
IoCs of ARP scanning:
1. Requests sent to sequential IP addresses
2. Requests sent to non-existent hosts
3. A sudden unusual volume of ARP traffic 

Here, an example file provided showcased in the info section in wireshark - increasing number
for the IP address.

In fact, nmap will perform such sequential scans.

What is the goal of ARP scanning?
An attacker may do this to get a list of live hosts.
Then, he may alter his strategy to deny service to all these live hosts.
Or, the attacker can try to poison everyone's ARP cache.
This is a strategy for a MitM attack.

Some possible follow-ups to such actions:
1. Tracing and identification. Locate and stop the activities of the malicious host.
2. Containment: It may also be wise to disconnect or isolate the area at the switch or router level.




802.11 Denial of Service
A link-layer attack that is prominent is one aimed at 802.11 which is the WiFi.

To examine the WiFi traffic, we would need a WIDS or WIPS system or a wireless interface capable of
monitor mode. Monitor mode allows viewing of raw 802.11 frames and other packet types that might
otherwise remain hidden.

To view information of our wireless network interfaces in Linux: iwconfig

Few methods to enable monitor mode:

1. aircrack-ng
The `airmon-ng` command is used to set a wireless interface (e.g., wlan0) into monitor mode.

2. system utilities
Call in sequence (bring down the wireless card => make it monitor mode => bring it back up):

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

You can then verify whether the network interface is indeed in monitor mode using `iwconfig`

To commence capturing - use aircrack-ng:
You need 3 parameters:
1. -c
This is the Access Point's channel you want to monitor

An access point (AP) channel refers to a specific radio frequency on which the wireless
network operates.

In Wi-Fi networks, APs can broadcast their signals over multiple channels within the 2.4 GHz
or 5 GHz frequency bands.

2. --bssid
This is a unique identifier assigned to each AP or wireless router.

3. -w <outputFileName>
This is to write the results to an output file.


Deauthentication Attacks / Dissociation attack
Idea:
The attacker sends deauthentication frames to one or more clients.
These deauthentication frames basically will disconnect the clients from the network.
These deauthentication frames appear to originate from the legitimate access point.

Then, when the client attempts to reconnect: the attack shall sniff the packets and crack it offline.

How it is performed:
Spoof the MAC address of the sender.

To prevent:
Have control tools like IEEE 802.11w (Management Frame Protection)

Detection of potential deauthentication attacks
In the notes we are provided a sample packet.
To limit view to only from AP's BSSID: use `wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`

To view deauthentication frames from our BSSID or an attacker pretending to send these from our BSSID:
(wlan.bssid == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) and (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12)
fc.type represents the frame management type == 0; and fc.type_subtype represents the subtype.
For deauthentication, the subtype is 12.

One IoC is massive amount of deauthentication frames sent to one client. (sign of DoS attack)
Another IoC is that in each of the frame, we see the same reason code.

A sophisticated attacker will change the reason code as he attacks.

Some measures to take are:
1. Enable IEEE 802.11w (Management Frame Protection) if possible
2. Utilise WPA3-SAE
3. Modify WIPS / WIDS detection rules.




Rogue Access Point and Evil Twin

Rogue Access Point is an access point illegally set up to bait people to connect to it (Wi-Fi), then
steal data from users.

An example could be someone setting up a personal wireless router in a company's cubicle
This creates a possible rogue access point where hackers can exploit to gain access to the network


Evil Twin is a copy of the actual wireless access point with spoofed mimicked SSID.
Intention is to trick people into connecting to it instead of the actual access point

Filter in wireshark that we could use: (wlan.fc.type == 00) and (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8)

Beacon frames
This are frames (type of packets) that is periodically emitted by Wireless Access Points to announce
its existence.
The filter above filters out beacon frames of the sort:
https://semfionetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/wireshark_802.11_filters_-_reference_sheet.pdf

Beacon analysis is useful in determining actual and fake access points.

A clear indicator: RSN is a type of security protocol used in Wi-Fi networks.
We can see if the network we connect to lack this; it could be a telltale sign of an evil twin.
Under tagged parameters in Wireshark, we observe Robust Security Network (RSN)

If such a situation occurs; by inspecting the identity of the device: we can apply a filter to observe
all victims: wlan.bssid == <MAC of device>



Fragmentation Attacks

This refers to exploitation of vulnerabilities of the way fragmented packets are handled by network devices.
Here, the focus is on IP layer.
The IP layer does not have mechanisms to detect packet loss, drops or tampering.

This is the reason why attackers tend to prey on this layer; malforming packets.

Concept of fragmentation and its abuse
Its purpose is to split large data sizes into smaller packets to be sent over the web.
The packets are then reassembled upon delivery.

MTU is used to determine the maximum payload size for a single packet.
Different protocols may have different MTUs. 

Some common strategies of attackers:
1. Fragmentation of scanning techniques.
If the IDS or IPS does not simulate reassembly of packets to detect the purpose of the packet, an attacker
can perform scans in fragments, hence possibly bypassing firewall controls.
This method can bypass a poorly configured firewall as well.

2. Flooding with very small MTU
This can tax system resources where the attacker hopes that the network does not reassemble the packets

3. Denial of Service with very large MTU (exceeding 65535 bytes)
65535 bytes is the max size of an IP packet including its headers.

A strategy to prevent the above:
1. Complete the reassembly of packets and inspecting it before proceeding.

We can observe the fragments above. The more fragments, the more suspicious.

Some other indicators mentioned: many ports on the defender's machine are visited in a short span of time; and some of the ports
being closed.

To view packets with TCP RST flag set to 1: tcp.flags.reset==1




IP Source and Destination Spoofing

When observing IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, the source IP should always come from our subnet.

Note that IP packets can be crafted; hence it is not so straightforward to immediately detect them.

Some attacks:
1. DDoS with changed source address
2. Changed-source of packets (goal is to bypass firewalls)
3. SMURF attacks
4. LAND attacks

SMURF attacks are done in the following way:

1. The attacker will send an ICMP request to live hosts with a spoofed address of the victim host
2. The live hosts will respond to the legitimate victim host with an ICMP reply
3. This may cause resource exhaustion on the victim host

An indicator is many ICMP requests. Sometimes attackers combine it with fragmentation

LAND attacks are done with the idea to block all ports:

1. Spoof the source and destination IP addresses to be the same
2. If all ports are occupied, real connections are more difficult to establish with the affected host.



IP Time-to-Live attacks
This is not really an attack; more of a means of evading detection. Just as the packet is about to expire,
the attacker catches the packet before it reaches the firewalls, IDS, IPS ...

This is done by setting a very small TTL. So the packet expires fast

One solution is to discard or filter out very small TTLs



TCP handshake abnormalities
For TCP connection:
1. Client sends TCP SYN-flagged request.
    Synchronised flag is set; desire to connect
2. If port is open and connectable, other client sends back a TCP SYN-ACK-flagged reply.
    Acknowledges and reserves some resources for the connection
3. Then client sends a TCP ACK-flagged request to mark the start of connection
    Is like a receipt. Completion of three-way handshake


Some abnormalies:
1. One host to many ports
2. One host to many hosts
3. Many and or unusual flags in packets
4. No flags (NULL scan)

For example: in an nmap scan, you will send a SYN-marked packet. For nmap scans, you will
send many separate packets to many different ports.

It will show up many [SYN] info in the packets in wireshark.
Two primary scans that shows up SYN - SYN stealth scans and SYN scans

For a NULL scan, the TCP connections behave as follows:
1. If port is open: system does not respond - simply because there are no flags!
2. If port is closed: system responds with an RST packet.

Another example: Too many [ACK] scans

In the case of an ACK scan TCP connections behave as follows:
1. If a port is open: system does not respond OR responds with RST-flagged packet
2. If a port is closed: system responds with an RST-flagged packet


Another indicator: Too many [FIN] scans

The TCP packets marked with FIN flag - marks termination of TCP connection.
Such an attack is called a FIN flood attack. The idea is to flood the TCP/IP stack.

In the case of a FIN scan, our machine will behave as follows:
1. If a port is open: system does not respond
2. If a port is closed: system responds with an RST-flagged packet 

Lastly, another indicator is too many flags. This is known as an Xmas tree scan.
Similarly, in the case of such a scan, our machine will behave as follows:
1. If a port is open: system does not respond or with an RST-flagged packet
2. If a port is closed: system responds with an RST-flagged packet.




TCP Connection Resets and Hijacks

Notice that connections can be terminated as discussed above by an attacker.
It can also be hijacked.

A TCP connection termination attack is known as a TCP RST packet injection attack.

Such an attack is conducted in this manner:
1. Change the attacker's own packet's source IP address to the victim's IP address.
2. Change TCP packet to contain RST flagged set to true.
3. Include valid sequence numbers in the forged packets.
Sequence numbers ensure proper sequencing of TCP segments.
4. Change the destination address and port to the desired target machine hosting the service.
The port should be chosen to hold services that the attacker wishes to deny from the victim
5. The target machine holding the service that we wish to deny from a victim machine will interpret
it as a disconnection, hence terminating the connection.
Examples: Port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, port 21 for FTP

From a defender's standpoint, if you see a lot of packets sent to one port, it is suspicious.




TCP Connection Hijacking
The idea here is that the attacker actively monitors the target connection that they wish to hijack.

Then the attack predicts the sequence numbers, and performs the same steps as the above, spoofing the
source IP address to the victim's.
Once a 3-way handshake reaches the 2nd way, the attacker acts as the victim, sending the last ACK packet
to the server with the service. This is to make information appear legitimately from the victim.

The attacker will have to, at the same time, block ACK packets from being sent from the victim's computer to the machine
with the service.

At this stage, the attacker can sent fake commands over to the server, whilst acting like it came from the victim
themselves.

Side note on Telnet: characters are sent one by one, as seen in Wireshark



Tunneling
The motivation for attackers using tunneling is to communicate with a specific host.
Another strong reason is that by doing so, security measures can be bypassed.

SSH tunneling is the most common. However, there are many other forms of tunneling.

ICMP tunneling
ICMP tunneling is a method to hide other forms of network traffic. Idea is to embed data within the ICMP packet.
The reason why ICMP is used is because it is common and raises less suspicion; more likely to pass through network
boundaries.

A way to figure out ICMP tunneling or suspicious behaviour: length of the packets.
A typical ICMP packets would be around 48 bytes. If the ICMP packet is very large, it is suspicious.

If you inspect the data of the ICMP packets: you can see the contents as well. From there you can see whether
extra data from an attacker is inside the payload of the ICMP packet(s).

A way to prevent such an attack is to block ICMP requests.
Otherwise, one can flag out length ICMP packets and perform inspection too.



HTTP / HTTPS service enumeration

Directory Fuzzing
Observe the large amounts of get requests in wireshark

Some techniques attackers employ is to set the request from different computers.
Or stagger the requests sent over a longer time frame.

To prevent such enumeration, we can send false response codes in the configuration to throw off attackers.
Another approach is to ban the IP addresses once we detect a spam in enumeration.



Strange HTTP headers
This is when an attacker sends weird headers where we pick them out.
This is a basic check where the attacker is trying to spoof the headers of a packet.

One trick to quickly identify failed requests that are possibly malicious: http response code 400.



HTTP Request Smuggling (CRLF)
This is a vulnerability that occurs due to discrepancies in how the front end and back end servers interpret
HTTP requests with regard to the Carriage Return Line Feed (CRLF) characters.
The idea is to contain another header within the packet via newline characters.


Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Code Injection Detection
An example of XSS. Escape the HTML > write JS code that sends data back to your (attacker) servers.

The effect is that because the browsers runs the client-side code, it will execute it.

There are a few types of XSS:
1. Stored XSS:
    Vulnerability arises if the data sent by one user is stored in the backend; it is displayed to other users
    without sanitisation
    Example: comments section. If an attacker figures that certain HTML tags are embedded in the comment section,
    the attacker can post a comment but with a malicious JS code. If the server does not check, it will display 
    the comment
2. Reflected XSS;
    Done via user inputs. In the user input, the attacker inputs malicious JS code.
    The injected script is "reflected" off the web server like an error message or an element on page.
    Example: phishing on web stores via reflected XSS on search input.

Telltale sign of XSS: a lot of HTTP requests are sent to internal server. 

Solution:
Always sanitise your user inputs
Never interpret user input as code.



SSL Renegotiation Attacks
HTTPS is secured version of HTTP:
1. Transport Layer Security (TLS)
2. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

Protocol for HTTPS: connection with server:
1. Handshake. Here, the decision of which encryption to algorithm to use and certificates are exchanged.
2. Encryption. Using the agreed-upon encryption algorithm
3. Further data exchange.
4. Decryption.

SSL renegotiation attacks are based on HTTPS.
The idea is that the attack tries to negotiate for the lowest possible encryption standard.

More on HTTPS procedure: After 3-way handshake
1. Client Hello message is sent to the server after the 3-way handshake.
Here, information regarding which TLS and SSL versions are supported by the client, a list of encryption
algorithms, and random data (nonces) to be used in the following steps.

2. Server Hello message is sent to the client.
This includes server's chosen TLS/ SSL version and encryption algorithm from client's choice. And an
additional nonce.

3. Certificate Exchange.
Server sends its digital certificate to the client, proving its identity.
The certificate contains the server's public key.

4. Key Exchange.
Client generates a premaster secret, encrypted using public key in 3., in the certificate of the server.

5. Session Key Derivation.
Both the client and the server use the nonces exchanged in the first two steps and the premaster secret
to compute the session keys.

These session keys are used for symmetric encryption and decryption of data during the secure connection.

6. Finished messages.
This is to mark the successful completion of the handshake and derivation of session keys.

7. Secured data exchange.
At this stage, data can be exchanged securely.



Finding irregularities in handshakes using Wireshark
Filter using "ssl.record.content_type == 22"

22 specifies handshake messages only.

For SSL renegotiation attacks, we are looking for
1. Multiple client hellos
2. Out-of-order handshake messages. The intention here is to confuse the server into accepting malicious
parameters

Malicious parameters in this case involve encryption algorithms, digital certificates, or parameters for
the public key exchange (Diffie-Hellman)

Purposes for such an attack:
1. Denial of Service. SSL renegotiation does consume a lot of server resources
2. Exploiting SSL / TLS weakness. Exploit vulnerabilities associated with some encryption algorithms.
3. Cryptanalysis and Pattern analysis




DNS Traffic
Forward lookups: when a device wants to resolve a domain name with an IP address.

DNS forward lookup query process:
1. Client wants to visit a domain name like facebook.com
2. Client initiates a DNS forward query
3. Client checks his local DNS cache
4. If mapping exists in the local DNS cache, client can just send the query to the IP address.
5. If mapping does not exist: client sends recursive query to its configured DNS recursive resolver cache
6. The DNS resolver will check with root servers (queries root servers) to find authoritative name servers
for the Top-Level Domain (TLD) of the domain name
7. The root server replies with address of the TLD servers, for DNS resolver to query.
8. DNS resolver sends the query to the corresponding TLD's authoritative name server. Client expects
the IP address of the authoritative name server.
9. DNS resolver queries the IP address of the authoritative name server for the IP address with the domain
name requested
10. The DNS resolver then receives the IP address (A or AAAA record) and sends it back to the client that
initiated the query.

A reverse lookup is a reverse process; we have the IP address and we want the name called Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN)
Here, the process is different:
1. The DNS resolver uses the IP address range to determine where to look. This range is called the reverse
lookup zone.
2. The DNS resolver then looks for a PTR record on the reverse lookup zone that corresponds with the IP address.
3. If a matching PTR is found, the DNS resolver returns the FQDN.

DNS enumeration is one form of action that an attacker can take.
A sign is large DNS traffic from one host

DNS tunneling is another form of action.
Example:
Setup:
Attacker has access to a compromised machine and wishes to transfer information out without being detected.
Attacker controls a malicious DNS server outside the network.
Attacker crafts a malware that can convert data into a form that can be packed into a DNS packet.
Attacker smuggles this data out to the DNS server via DNS and its protocols.

So a way to tell if DNS tunneling is occurring is to observe the DNS packets; if there is text data on the packets,
which possibly may be encoded or encrypted, then you can guess that DNS tunneling is occurring.


InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/ipfs-gateway/concepts/ipfs/
A distributed file storage protocol that allows computers all over the globe to store and serve files as part of a
giant peer-to-peer network.

Any computer, anywhere in the world, can download the IPFS software and start hosting and serving files.

If someone runs IPFS on their computer and uploads a file to the IPFS network, that file can be viewed and downloaded
by anyone else in the world who is also running IPFS.

This is a P2P method for sharing data.

The point of introducing IPFS is because malicious actors store malicious files on this IPFS servers.

The issue is that it is very difficult to detect due to is P2P nature.

The best thing we can do is observe DNS and or HTTP/HTTPS traffic to URLs of the form:

For why P2P nature makes detection harder:

A P2P network has no centralisation and hence you cannot just observe all traffic without having control over
all the nodes.

Also, since the nodes come and go very dynamically, it is hard to capture a traffic within a time frame and map its flow.

Another reason is the encrypted nature of P2P traffic. This severely makes it difficult to observe what data is being
transmitted through the network.

Side note: it is possible to chain-encode (like triple encode) a string which makes it trickier to decode.



Telnet and UDP connections
This is dealing with telnet and UDP traffic.
Telnet is on the TCP protocol layer. 

Telnet protocol:
You have a telnet server and client.
We interact with the telnet client via the terminal driver. Similarly, the application interacts with the telnet server
via a pseudoterminal driver.

The bridge between the telnet client and server is a Network Virtual Tunnel (NVT)

Telnet is mainly used by older devices and is replaced by SSH nowadays.
Telnet's service is conventionally at port 23 and is not encrypted. Hence easy to study via wireshark.

One approach we can take is to observe suspicious communication from one Telnet client.
Follow stream on wireshark and you can see the sequence of data flow.

If you see Telnet traffic over IPv6, it should raise suspicion.
Telnet is conventionally transmitted over IPv4.
IPv6 has more security features which also means it can be better for evasion for attackers.

It is theoretically possible for an attacker to use a different protocol for Telnet; like UDP.
As long as the protocol is on TCP layer, all TCP protocols are possible to be used by Telnet.
Hence it is good to observe all traffic on the TCP layer just for a possible attack via Telnet.

UDP is a good option for attackers in this case because UDP is faster and some firewalls do not have much
security scrutiny over UDP traffic
