This exercise will focus on communicating with the SQL service directly without going
through the web application.

Enumerate: nmap -sC and -sV
This time -sC will run a default set of scripts, some of which are considered intrusive.
But allowed in this exercise. -sV is scan type version to detect version of services.

We see that a database service is running on port 3306: MySQL

Here, we have to install an interface to interact with the service.
I have observed that for many of the practices, it could be the case that for a particular
service, there is typically a tool to interface and interact with it.
For this case, we install the tool: mysql

Then we call mysql -h the virtual machine IP address -u root
Typically, it is not possible to log in; one needs credentials. But this is just an exercise
where we assume that the service is misconfigured and we can immediately connect to the service.

Some commands then used:

SHOW databases;
shows all database

use databaseName;
will begin interacting with the database with name databaseName

We can then do SHOW tables;
to show all tables

Then to query for all records: SELECT * FROM config;

Here we can see the flag value: 7b4bec00d1a39e3dd4e021ec3d915da8
