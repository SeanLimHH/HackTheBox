The task is FTP: used for transferring files.

FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

A port running an active service is reserved to receive requests and send results from.
This enables multiple active services to be ran - on different ports. 

SSH is an active service on another port existing simultaneously with FTP.
Even if the client connects to the server via SSH: the files transferred from server
to the FTP port is not encrypted and is in plaintext. 

It is possible for a Man in the Middle attack to occur here on communication between
FTP port and the server when files are being transferred; despite SSH connection with server.

Hence, it is important to encrypt the files transferred from the FTP port.

This means that the files are transferred from the SSH port: the FTP protocol gets moved 
into the SSH port:
it becomes secured from any interception.

FTP usually sits on port 21

Ping does not usually work against big corporations, and firewalls can have rules to prevent
pinging between hosts.

In this task, it is simpler: connecting to an FTP server.

We use FTP command to connect to the virtual machine.

A typical misconfiguration of FTP, just like in the exercise: uses the default username anonymous.
It enables anonymous accounts to access the FTP service just like any authenticated user.
So it will disregard any password.

In this case, i input the username anonymous and any password.

Logging in, we use ls to list the files. There is flag.txt.

Then the task is to download it: using "get" command. This downloads the file to the
same location which i called the FTP command.

Exiting, we check the flag: cat flag.txt:

The flag: 035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815
